# ImageClassification_SVM-RF

In this paper, we will discuss two different methods of classification for a whole dataset of images that came from the Columbia Photographic Images and Photorealistic Computer Graphic Dataset. Those two methods would be Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classification. In this paper we will give a description and the process of each classification method. Furthermore, we will be comparing its effectiveness with the Logistic Regression method, by using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) function to see which method of classification works best for the dataset of images. When comparing with the results with the Logistic Regression, we see that both methods do better, however the random forest classification seems to be able to do a better job at classification than the other two. Finally, we will do some cross validation as well to compares the different methods and conclude.
